### Issue Summary
**Duration of the Outage:**  
Start: June 5, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC  
End: June 5, 2024, 4:30 PM UTC  

**Impact:**  
Our e-commerce platform experienced a complete outage for 2.5 hours. During this period, users were unable to access the website, resulting in a 100% service disruption. Approximately 75,000 users were affected, leading to significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured database server which led to a cascade of failures within the application servers, eventually causing a complete service outage.

### Timeline
- **2:00 PM:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in database response times.
- **2:05 PM:** On-call engineer receives an alert and begins initial investigation.
- **2:10 PM:** Engineer verifies the issue and identifies high database query latency.
- **2:15 PM:** Engineer assumes the problem is due to a recent code deployment and rolls back the changes.
- **2:25 PM:** Rollback is completed, but the issue persists.
- **2:30 PM:** Escalation to the database team.
- **2:35 PM:** Database team identifies a configuration anomaly in the database server settings.
- **2:50 PM:** Misleading investigation paths include checking network configurations and application code for potential bugs.
- **3:00 PM:** Configuration correction begins on the primary database server.
- **3:30 PM:** Database server is restarted with the correct configuration.
- **4:00 PM:** Services begin to recover gradually.
- **4:30 PM:** Full service is restored, and monitoring confirms stability.

### Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:**  
The database server was misconfigured due to an incorrect parameter set during routine maintenance. This misconfiguration caused the server to handle queries inefficiently, leading to increased latency and eventual timeouts. The issue cascaded to the application servers, which were unable to maintain stable connections to the database, resulting in a complete service outage.

**Resolution:**  
The database team identified the incorrect configuration and corrected the parameters. After verifying the new configuration, the database server was restarted, which resolved the query latency issues. Once the database was stable, the application servers were able to reconnect and resume normal operations.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements/Fixes:**  
- Improve the configuration management process to prevent incorrect settings.
- Enhance monitoring to detect configuration anomalies before they cause service disruptions.
- Conduct regular training for engineers on database configuration best practices.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**  
- Implement a configuration management tool to automate and validate database server configurations.
- Add specific monitoring checks for database configuration settings.
- Update the maintenance protocol to include double-checks for critical configuration changes.
- Schedule a training session on database configuration for all relevant engineering teams.
